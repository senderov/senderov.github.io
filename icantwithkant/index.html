            <h5 class="description">In the words of Immanuel Kant, "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed nonage."
            In essence, it is the end of man's reliance on others for guidance and their regained ability to develop an understanding of their own.

            <br><br>During the Age of Enlightenment individuals once again began to truly think for themselves, something that had not been
            done since ancient times. Tied in with the Scientific Revolution, The Age of Enlightenment gave birth to many new political,
            philosophical, economic, religious, and scientific ideas. At its centre were the great thinkers of the modern era, whose doctrines and
            ideologies continue to inspire governments and revolutions to this day.</h5>

                    François-Marie Arouet, better known by his pen name, Voltaire, was a Parisian Nobleman.
                    He believed that the church halted human development. In his eyes, the aristocracy was corrupt, commoners are ignorant and superstitious,
                    and the bourgeoisie were too few to rule. Voltaire claimed that governments should be run by intellectuals and advocated excessively for freedom of thought
                    and speech. Voltaire was not a revolutionary and did not believe in social or economic equality. He called only for government reform, once again criticising the
                    governments for being non-secular and ruling by the Christian Church.</p>

                    Those rights could never be taken away or voluntarily surrendered by any individual. In his <i>Two Treatises of Government</i>, John Locke details
                    a government system based on the social contract theory, where the government can only be formed with the consent of all of its subjects.
                    He claims that the purpose of a government is to protect the natural rights of all individuals, and any government that fails to do so can and should be replaced.

                    <p class="card-description">Rousseau was the only philosophe to come from a working-class family. He believed that man is naturally good but is corrupted by society.
                    People in a state of nature are free, equal, peaceful, and happy. When people begin to claim ownership of property, inequality, murder, and war result.
                    He argued that powerful rich stole land from the poor and fooled them into accepting them as rulers. The only way to protect all people's right to
                    life, liberty, and property was not through a monarchy. In his ideas, all power must belong to the people and to the general will of the people.
                    His book "The Social Contract" introduced these ideas of general will and popular sovereignty, eventually helping kickstart the French Revolution.</p>

                    liberty, and individual right to property. Montesquieu introduced the "checks and balances" system of government. In this system, the power of an executive branch would be balanced
                    by a multi-party legislature. Both of these branches of government would further be kept in check by the judicial system to make sure no single part could make absolute rulings.
                    This system he believed was the only way to prevent tyranny and ensure liberty. It is used even today, most notably in the United States.</p>

                    <p class="card-description">Mary Wollstonecraft was an outlier in the realm of Enlightenment thinkers. Not only was she a woman, but she wrote and spoke about topics that
                    most others of the era didn't even bother to address. She advocated for equality of the sexes, that all men and women were created equal. Wollstonecraft believed that
                    women were too frequently perceived in society as inferior and subservient to men. She criticised the other major Enlightenment thinkers for entirely ignoring the rights
                    of women. In <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>, she argued that women were not naturally inferior to men but only appeared so due to lack of education and representation.
                    Wollstonecraft established the basis for the feminist movement that began during the nineteenth century.</p>

                    <p class="card-description">Hobbes was a privileged son in the British aristocracy. He had a very different view from most other Enlightenment figures, he preferred a more conservative
                    rather than radical approach to political reform. Hobbes believed that all men were born with free will but if left unchecked they would eventually end up in conflict. He believed leaving men without
                    government would result in a permanent state of anarchy with no human advancement. Hobbes argued that the only way to ensure order is to put authority in the hands on one absolute power.
                    Men would surrender their free will to that power, which once empowered can do anything to ensure peace. Hobbes, like many others, was against the meddling of the church in government. His work
                    <i>Leviathan</i> became a classic defence for the use of absolute monarchy. </p>
