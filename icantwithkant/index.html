            <h5 class="description">In the words of Immanuel Kant, "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed nonage."
            In essence, it is the end of man's reliance on others for guidance and their regained ability to develop and understanding of their own.

            <br><br>During the Age of Enlightenment individuals once again began to truly think for themselves, something that had not been
            done since ancient times. Tied in with the Scientific Revolution, The Age of Enlightenment gave birth to many new political,
            philosophical, economic, religious, and scientific ideas. At its centre were the great thinkers of the modern era, whose doctrines and
            ideologies continue to inspire governments and revolutions to this day.</h5>

                    François-Marie Arouet, better known by his pen name, Voltaire, was a Parisian Nobleman.
                    He believed that the church halted human development. In his eyes, aristocracy was corrupt, commoners are ignorant and superstitious,
                    and the bourgeoisie were too few to rule. Voltaire claimed that governments should be run by intellectuals and advocated excessively for freedom of thought
                    and speech. Voltaire was not a revolutionary and did not believe in social or economic euqality. He called only for government reform, once again criticising the
                    governments for being non-secular and ruling by the Christian Church.</p>

                    Those rights could nevber be taken away or voluntarily surrendered by any individual. In his <i>Two Treatises of Government</i>, John Locke details
                    a government system based on the social contract theory, where the government can only be formed with the consent of all of its subjects.
                    He claims that the purpose of a government is to protect the natural rights of all individuals, and any government that fails to do so can and should be replaced.

                    <p class="card-description">Rousseau was the only philosophe to come from a working class family. He believed that man is naturally good but is corrupted by society.
                    People in a state of nature are free, equal, peaceful, and happy. When people begin to claim ownership of property, inequality, murder, and war result.
                    He argued that powerful rich stole land from the poor and fooled them into accepting them as rulers. Tthe only way to protect all people's right to
                    life, liberty, and property was not through a monarchy. In his ideals, all power must belong to the people and to the general will of the people.
                    His book "The Social Contract" introduced these ideas of general will and popular sovereignty, eventually helping kickstart the French Revolution.</p>
