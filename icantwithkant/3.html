            <h3 class="title">Concordat of 1801</h3>
            <h5 class="description">The Concordat or 1801 was the first major action by Napoleon as leader of France. Its goal was simple: to solve the issue of religious hostilities among Catholics. The Concordat was an agreement between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. It established the Catholic Church as the major religion in France. The social status of the Church was restored and clergy was allowed to return from exile and resume their practices. The Church was free to practice and hold observances as long as they did not pose a threat to public safety. The clergy would go under payroll from the French state after declaring their allegiance to the state. Lastly, the Concordat stated that the Catholic Church would abdicate all claims to land confiscated during the revolution. The Concordat stayed in effect until 1905.</h5>

            <h3 class="title">Code Napoleon - 1804</h3>
            <h5 class="description">The primary goal of Napoleon's legal code was to reorganise the French legal system so that it functioned the same way in every region and for every person in France. It was written to suit the ideas of the French Revolution and created general rules reducing the need for case law and judges. The Napoleonic code was inspired by Justinian's Code during the Byzantine empire, but the two bore little resemblance to each other. The code contained many, but not all, of the ideas from the revolution. It created equality under the law for every French citizen. It gave property owners full rights to their land, allowing them to sell it, transfer it, or lend it out to others. The code completely abolished the hereditary class system as well as all legal and tax exemptions. Even with his earlier agreement to make the Roman Catholic Church the primary religion in France, Napoleon's code guaranteed religious freedom to everyone in France.
            </h5><h5 class="description">But not all about this new set of laws was good. Napoleon's Code forbade the unionisation of workers, which would eventually become an area of conflict during the rise of capitalism. Lastly, Napoleon stripped away all the rights of all women. He granted men exclusive control over family property, sent all women's wages to their husbands, fathers, or sons, and made them legally dependant on their spouses or closest male relatives. Divorce by mutual consent was also abolished. The code was loved by most but was heavily criticised by certain groups in France, primarily women.</h5>
            <h5 class="description">Shortly after the code was passed, Napoleon was proclaimed emperor of France. He crowned himeself that same year.</h5>

            <h3 class="title">Early Nationalism</h3>
            <h5 class="description">Napoleon used the French military to promote the concept of nationalism. He created the first citizen army, imposing a military draft that allowed him to raise large armies very quickly. The French national anthem, the Marseillaise, was introduced to help create a greater sense of unity among soldiers. He embraced a concept similar to Popular sovereignty: the character of the nation would be determined by the people. Napoleon used these ideas to spread the belief that fighting for France meant fighting for oneself, and instilled national pride all over France.</h5>

            <h3 class="title">Conquest</h3>
            <h5 class="description">With the help of his massive armies, Napoleon set out to expand reform and the empire. He would take over regions with his army, and then establish a reformed constitution for the region. He would then put a member of his family in charge, or leave the local government as long as it remained loyal. Napoleon used his power to spread revolutionary ideas across Europe.</h5>
            <h5 class="description">Napoleon had also been at war with Britain since before becoming Emperor. In 1806, after a British blockade of the French coast, Napoleon implemented the Continental System. The Continental System was an embargo of Britain and prevented subjects and allies of the French empire from trading with Britain. Napoleon was allied with Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Prussia, and Russia. This meant that by 1810 when Napoleon's empire was at its largest, almost all of Europe aside from Portugal and the Baltics was either at war with or embargoing Britain. This system succeeded in lowering British trade with the continent but had little actual effect on the British economy. Its failure was instrumental in the fall of Napoleon.</h5>

            <h3 class="title">Nationalism and the Fall of Napoleon</h3>
            <h5 class="description">There was a lot of political tension throughout the French Empire. His subject states were becoming furious at the use of their men to fight France's endless wars and at the heavy taxes outside of main France. Many smaller kingdoms started developing nationalistic feelings. They were brought together by a need for common defence against Napoleon. Nowhere was this feeling stronger than in the Confederation of the Rhine, a loose alliance established by Napoleon in 1806 after the breakup of the Holy Roman Empire. The Confederation of the Rhine consisted of around 30 Germanic states and was subject to a heavy military draft of tens of thousands of men or about one per cent of its male population. After the fall of Napoleon and the Confederation, this sense of Nationalism remained and would play an important role in German unification half a century later.</h5>
            <h5 class="description">The end began when Tzar Alexander I left the ineffective Continental System and resumed trade with Britain. Napoleon was outraged and he raised The Grand Army, which, with over 680 thousand men, was the largest army in history up until that point. Under the ruse of the Second Polish War, a campaign to liberate Poland, he marched on Russia in hope of compelling them to stop trade with Britain. The Russian army implemented their scorched-earth policy and kept retreating further into its lands leaving only burned cities behind. After winning two major battles at Smolensk and Borodino, Napoleon hoped to negotiate with Tzar Alexander. Alexander refused. When Napoleon reached the burned city of Moscow, the brutal winter had begun to set in. With little food and shelter, the horses dying of starvation, and Russian guerilla tactics unpredictably decimating the army, Napoleon was forced to retreat. Less than ten per cent of his army made it out.</h5>
            <h5 class="description">Napoleon returned to Paris to raise a second army. This army was significantly less skilled than the previous one, and by the time he had organised in Austria, Prussia, and many states from the Confederation of the Rhine had joined sides with Russia. Napoleon faced this coalition in 1813 at the battle of Leipzig and lost. Six months later Napoleon abdicated the throne, and Louis XVIII, a Bourbon, became the new Emperor. Louis XVIII kept most of Napoleon's legal reforms, including the code.</h5>
