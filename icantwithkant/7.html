        <h5 class="description">World War I was the bloodiest war the world had ever seen up until that point. Almost forty million military and civilians are estimated to have died. The amount of destruction during the war horrified everyone in Europe. World War I was well known as the War to End All Wars, but ironically that would only be the case for two decades.</h5>
        <h2 class="title">Causes</h2>
        <h5 class="description">There is no universal consensus on what started WWI, but its beginning can usually be attributed to four things: militarism, imperialism, nationalism, and unease from European treaties.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Militarism</h3>
        <h5 class="description">With the Industrial Revolution came the power to mass produce weapons and war vehicles. European nations began rapidly increasing their military strength to prepare for any upcoming wars. However, many nations took the mass production of weapons as an act of aggression and began mass producing them themselves. This led to a massive arms race across all of Europe and massive tensions between nations.</h5>
        <h5 class="description">The most significant of these arms races was between England and Germany. Known as the Anglo-German naval arms race, it was widely blamed for the advent of WWI. Before the war, Britain had a policy where their navy must be larger than the next two larger navies. Germany became concerned that the British would heavily overpower them in any conflict and started building their own massive navy. Britain noticed the growing German navy as a threat to their economy and began responding by building more warships. Eventually, Germany had realised that they could not out-manufacture Britain and began mass-producing a technology only it possessed: submarines. German submarines, known as U-Boats became one of the most important military inventions in WWI and had a heavy effect on the progression and outcome of the war.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Imperialism</h3>
        <h5 class="description">Imperial tensions had a significant effect on World War I. Despite the best efforts of the Berlin Conference to partition Africa in the most conflict-free way, imperial powers kept encountering each other significantly more frequently while creating colonies. Since these nations were then competing over with each other over the same pieces of land, tensions began to rise rapidly between European empires. These tensions contributed to the creation of several different alliance systems and eventually to the war.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Various Alliance Systems</h3>
        <h4 class="title">Three Emperors League</h4>
        <h5 class="description">When Germany emerged as a major power under Bismarck, he wanted peace in Europe. To him, France was the greatest threat. The Three Emperors League was a political agreement between Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary decreeing that French-origin liberalism must be defeated. Russia and Austria-Hungary began fighting over Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Balkans, Russia had been promoting Slavic nationalism and Austria-Hungary and Austria-Hungary were not happy with increasing demands from the Slavs in their empire. The League dissolved only a few years after its formation in 1873.</h5>
        <h4 class="title">Triple Alliance</h4>
        <h5 class="description">The triple alliance began as the Dual Alliance in 1879. It was a military agreement orchestrated by Bismarck between Germany and Austria-Hungary. As a reaction to militarization in Russia, they agreed to come to each other's aid if either were to be invaded by Russia. The Dual Alliance also prevented Austria-Hungary from creating an alliance with France. Italy later joined in 1882 and the group became the Triple Alliance.</h5>
        <h4 class="title">Reinsurance Treaty</h4>
        <h5 class="description">The Reinsurance treaty was put in place by Bismarck(again) this time to focus on the Russian threat on Germany's eastern front. It was a diplomatic agreement signed between Germany and Russia where both powers pledged neutrality against each other in the looming threat war. The treaty was renewed annually and isolated France as Germany's only threat. The treaty fell apart after Wilhelm II removed Bismarck and refused to renew it.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Triple Entente</h3>
        <h5 class="description">The Triple Entente formed as an alliance between three of the Major European powers: Russia, France, and Britain</h5>
        <h4 class="title">Russo-French Alliance - 1894</h4>
        <h5 class="description">After Wilhelm II removed Bismarck and cancelled the Reinsurance Treaty, he announced that he wanted to expand Germany. Russia became concerned with this new threat of German aggression and began its search for allies. Coincidentally, France was also desperate for allies against Germany and had strong cultural and economic influence in Russia. Russia was largely affected by French culture and 25% of French foreign investments had been in Russia. The alliance was welcomed on both sides and provided protection from Germany.</h5>
        <h4 class="title">The Situation in Britain</h4>
        <h5 class="description">For a long time before the war, Britain operated under what they called "Splendid Isolation." Under this policy they would fight with nobody and trade with everybody, avoiding draining continental conflicts while making large sums of money in the process. Britain had only one obligation on the mainland: an agreement signed in 1839 to protect Belgian neutrality.</h5>
        <h5 class="description">There was, however, a lot of tension between Britain and Germany. The rapid industrialisation of Germany and the buildup of the German navy posed a severe economic and political threat to Britain. Wilhelm II was the grandson of the British queen and severely disliked Britain. German politicians believed it was time for Germany to lead the world and Britain viewed this as an act of aggression and began seeking out allies.</h5>
        <h4 class="title">Anglo-French Entente - 1904</h4>
        <h5 class="description">The Anglo-French Entente was an unusual alliance. Historically France and England had been bitter enemies, and the Entente intended to change that. It was a diplomatic alliance where France and Britain were to recognise and not interfere with each other's interests in northern Africa. It created a new period of understanding between Britain and France and put an end to the constant war between them.</h5>
        <h4 class="title">Anglo-Russian Entente - 1907</h4>
        <h5 class="description">The Anglo-Russian Entente was also unusual for the same reasons as the alliance between Britain and France. Britain was concerned about Russian interference in India and Persia. To Britain, Russia had the possibility of becoming a massive threat. If Russia were to decide to industrialise, its larger population, an abundance of natural resources, and large amounts of land would put an end to British economic superiority. In 1904 and 1905 however, Russia was absolutely decimated by Japan, and it became clear that Japan was an even more imminent threat to Europe. The alliance between England and Russia formed under two conditions. The first was that Russia would recognise British dominance in Afghanistan. The second was an agreement to divide Persia, a territory both Britain and Russia wanted, into 3 spheres of influence: the Russian zone, the British zone, and an intermediary zone in between them.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Nationalism</h3>
        <h5 class="description">
          The event that began the irreversible spiral into global war began with nationalism. On 28 June 1914, Serbian nationalists assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. They wanted to separate from the oppressive Empire and form their own independent state, Yugoslavia(Literally: southern Slav land). Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia, which was rejected. Russia, wanting to protect its Serbian ally began to mobilise troops to the Austro-Hungarian and German borders. Alarmed by the sudden influx of Russian troops Germany also began mobilising on its eastern front.</h5>
        <h2 class="title">Global War</h2>
        <h5 class="description">Once Russia and Germany began fighting, war began. Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia, and Germany declared war on Russia's French ally. While invading France, Germany was forced to travel around into French land through Belgium. England fulfilled its promise to protect Belgian neutrality and declared war on Germany. And thus, in an incredibly rapid downward spiral, began the War to End All Wars.</h5>
