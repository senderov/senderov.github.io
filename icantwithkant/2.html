            <h5 class="description">The French Revolution was influenced by several factors. The main cause was the effect of the rapid deterioration
              and disappearance of the feudal system. All over Europe, the middle-class bourgeoisie were growing in numbers, and peasants were
              beginning to experience improved quality of life and access to education. The French population was growing at a rapidly increasing
              rate, and people began demanding more and more from their government. The discussion of political reform began spreading rapidly
              across France, helped by greater-than-ever literacy rates. The ideas that had begun during the Enlightenment began taking hold of
              minorities and majorities everywhere. Popular were the works and ideas of Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau, who believed in
              secular governments, consent of the governed, and the possession of unalienable rights. But it was clear that the only way to
              establish this kind of reform when facing the failing French monarchy was via a revolution.</h5>

            <h3 class="title">French Society and Government</h3>
            <h5 class="description">Before going into the French Revolution, it is first necessary to explain how the French government
              functioned before the revolution. France was a divine right monarchy. It was governed absolutely by Louis XVI, who controlled
              the courts, the treasury, and enforced and made laws. France had a legislative assembly called the Estates General that consisted
              of representatives from all three social classes. As the power to call or dismiss it lay exclusively with the king, the assembly
              had not been called since 1614.
              <br><br>
              The French population was socially divided into three distinct groups through the Estate System consisting of the First, Second,
              and Third Estates. The First Estate was the clergy. It made up one per cent of the population, owned ten per cent of the land,
              and was exempt from all taxes. It was divided into the noble-born high clergy and the peasant-born parish priests. The Second
              Estate was the French nobility. They made up two per cent of the population and owned a quarter to a third of all French land.
              These were the primary government officials, military leaders, tax collectors, and economic frontrunners. The Third Estate was
              the peasantry. They made up almost all of the French population and were the only group that paid taxes. The Third Estate was
              divided into the professional bourgeoisie, such as doctors and lawyers, the commercial bourgeoisie, skilled craftsmen and merchants,
              and the peasantry, half of which owned no land and which was still subject to feudal ideas often needing to pay heavy fees to use community services.

                      <p>First and foremost, France was in economic trouble. After having fought the seven years war and the American Revolution,
                        France was in massive debt. The drought of 1787 and 1788 put the nation even further into crisis and strengthened inequality.
                        The King's solution was to tax the first and second estates, but they refused and the third estate was forced to carry the
                        heavy burden on top of their already astronomically high tax rate.</p>
                      <p>The other major cause was the grievances among the Third Estate. They disliked being forced to carry the tax burden of the
                        nation while also possessing the least money. They hated the estate system for being oppressive and hereditary, even the
                        richest and most well-written member of the Third Estate could not become nobility. The Third Estate was also disappointed
                        with the fragments of feudalism ideology that they were forced to follow.</p>
                      <p>Failing to solve the national economic crisis, Louis XVI was left with only one choice. He called an assembly of the Estates-General.
                        Whether on purpose or by fate, the Third Estate, making up the largest and most demanding body of the Estates-General, was locked out
                        of the convention. They convened on a nearby tennis court and formed what would later become the first of four revolutionary governments:
                        The National Assembly. The Assembly members took the Tennis Court Oath, vowing to not dismiss until they had written a new constitution of
                        France. Louis XVI responded by defensively surrounding the palace of Versailles with troops and dismissed Jacques Necker, who was a popular
                        minister of state due to his support of government reform. The Third Estate Parisians, inspired by the National Assembly reacted, and on
                        14th July of 1789 in search of arms and in a monumental act of symbolism, they stormed the Bastille fortress at the centre of Paris,
                        solidifying the power of the National Assembly.</p>
                      <p>And thus began the French Revolution.</p>
