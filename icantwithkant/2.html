            <h5 class="description">The French Revolution was influenced by several factors. The main cause was the effect of the rapid deterioration
              and disappearance of the feudal system. All over Europe, the middle-class bourgeoisie were growing in numbers, and peasants were
              beginning to experience improved quality of life and access to education. The French population was growing at a rapidly increasing
              rate, and people began demanding more and more from their government. The discussion of political reform began spreading rapidly
              across France, helped by greater-than-ever literacy rates. The ideas that had begun during the Enlightenment began taking hold of
              minorities and majorities everywhere. Popular were the works and ideas of Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau, who believed in
              secular governments, consent of the governed, and the possession of unalienable rights. But it was clear that the only way to
              establish this kind of reform when facing the failing French monarchy was via a revolution.</h5>

            <h3 class="title">French Society and Government</h3>
            <h5 class="description">Before going into the French Revolution, it is first necessary to explain how the French government
              functioned before the revolution. France was a divine right monarchy. It was governed absolutely by Louis XVI, who controlled
              the courts, the treasury, and enforced and made laws. France had a legislative assembly called the Estates General that consisted
              of representatives from all three social classes. As the power to call or dismiss it lay exclusively with the king, the assembly
              had not been called since 1614.
              <br><br>
              The French population was socially divided into three distinct groups through the Estate System consisting of the First, Second,
              and Third Estates. The First Estate was the clergy. It made up one per cent of the population, owned ten per cent of the land,
              and was exempt from all taxes. It was divided into the noble-born high clergy and the peasant-born parish priests. The Second
              Estate was the French nobility. They made up two per cent of the population and owned a quarter to a third of all French land.
              These were the primary government officials, military leaders, tax collectors, and economic frontrunners. The Third Estate was
              the peasantry. They made up almost all of the French population and were the only group that paid taxes. The Third Estate was
              divided into the professional bourgeoisie, such as doctors and lawyers, the commercial bourgeoisie, skilled craftsmen and merchants,
              and the peasantry, half of which owned no land and which was still subject to feudal ideas often needing to pay heavy fees to use community services.

                      <p>First and foremost, France was in economic trouble. After having fought the seven years war and the American Revolution,
                        France was in massive debt. The drought of 1787 and 1788 put the nation even further into crisis and strengthened inequality.
                        The King's solution was to tax the first and second estates, but they refused and the third estate was forced to carry the
                        heavy burden on top of their already astronomically high tax rate.</p>
                      <p>The other major cause was the grievances among the Third Estate. They disliked being forced to carry the tax burden of the
                        nation while also possessing the least money. They hated the estate system for being oppressive and hereditary, even the
                        richest and most well-written member of the Third Estate could not become nobility. The Third Estate was also disappointed
                        with the fragments of feudalism ideology that they were forced to follow.</p>
                      <p>Failing to solve the national economic crisis, Louis XVI was left with only one choice. He called an assembly of the Estates-General.
                        Whether on purpose or by fate, the Third Estate, making up the largest and most demanding body of the Estates-General, was locked out
                        of the convention. They convened on a nearby tennis court and formed what would later become the first of four revolutionary governments:
                        The National Assembly. The Assembly members took the Tennis Court Oath, vowing to not dismiss until they had written a new constitution of
                        France. Louis XVI responded by defensively surrounding the palace of Versailles with troops and dismissed Jacques Necker, who was a popular
                        minister of state due to his support of government reform. The Third Estate Parisians, inspired by the National Assembly reacted, and on
                        14th July of 1789 in search of arms and in a monumental act of symbolism, they stormed the Bastille fortress at the centre of Paris,
                        solidifying the power of the National Assembly.</p>
                      <p>And thus began the French Revolution.</p>

                    <div class="tab-pane" id="Moderate Phase">
                      <p>The Moderate Phase of the French Revolution lasted from 1789 to 1792. The moderate phase began with the declaration of the rights of man in 1789.
                      It was written by Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, a catholic clergyman, Marquis de Lafayette, a French military officer, and Thomas Jefferson, one
                      of the founding fathers of America. The document focused on legal equality, destruction of the estate system and the birthright heirarchy, as
                      and the fundamental natural rights of man. It heavily influenced the French Constitution of 1791. <a href="" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal"> Click Here to read all the articles.</a></p>
                      <p>In 1789, women in France were nto happy about high bread prices. They became mixed in with the revolutionary movement. This mod of women consisted of thousands of people.
                      Inspired by the revolution, they stole weapons from the Parisian armories and marched upon Versailles to force the Kings hand. They successfully besieged the palace and
                      Louis XVI, as well as his family and his government were made to go to Paris where he could better serve his people.</p>
                      <p>The National Assembly dissolved and became the Legislative Assembly. With its new constitution the Assembly gained large power in France. The constitution addressed the issues of political and economic
                      inequality and the failing absolute monarchy. Louis XVI was forced to sign this constitution which heavily limited his power allowing him only executive power and the ability
                      to veto laws, something that would also eventually be taken away from him. The constitution also removed all the special privileges of the first
                      and second estate, letting formerly third estate individuals take on roles in the government and forcing all citizens to pay taxes. The National Assembly also
                      made several changes to better govern France and improve economy. Mainly, they split France in to departments with similar sizes and populations,
                      abolished internal tarrifs to promote internal trade, and adopted the metric measurement system nationwide to replace the may systems that existed in various regions.
                      It is important to note that the guillotine was invented in 1791, as it would become one of the symbols of the French revolution.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane" id="Radical Phase">
                      <p>Many things contributed to the transition of the French Revolution into its radical phase. The first reason was the formation of the counter-revolution. These
                      counter-revolutionaries were loyalist of the Church and King led by former first and second estate members and with support from many catholics. The counter-revolution
                      threatened the accomplishments of the revolutionaries, who had previously believed that their work had been successfully accomplished, and forced the revolution to take a
                      much more drastic approach than planned. In addition, many members of the working class believed that despite their large contributions to the revolution they had
                      received little in return. The tipping point happened when the king failed to esape from Paris to Varennes to try to start another counter-revolution among the French army.</p>
                      <p>In the 1790s France had two major political groups. The Jacobins/Montagnards, led by Maximilien Robespierre were the more radical party, believing that and end to the monarchy was
                      necessary. The Girondins also believed that a republic was the best thing for France, but unlike the Jacobins they resisted the spiral of violence that the French Revolution was
                      heading toward. In 1792, the Jacobins were planning an insurrection. They gained rapid support of the Parisians, who were dissapointed with inflation and the high price of goods.
                      On August 10, they attacked the King's palace in France, killing hundreds of guards and forcing the royal family to flee and take refuge with the Legislative Assembly.
                      The King was stripped of all his power, and the constitutional monarchy had no monarch. Roughly a month later on 22 September, the French Republic headed by the National Convention
                      was established to replace the failed monarchy.</p>
                      <p>Louis XVI was placed on trial for treason, and much to the dissapointment of the Girondins, was sentenced to death. The execution took place on 21 January, 1793, and marked
                      the point of absolutely no return for the French Revolution. Wars with nearly every other European power plaecd the government in great civil unrest. Facing civil and foreign war,
                      the leadership grew more and more radical. In summer of 1793, the Jacobins replaced the Girondins as the dominant political force in the National Convention. With the Girondins
                      defeated, the Jacobins placed Robespierre at the head of France's executive power, the Committee of Public Safety. This gave Robespiere almost limitless power over the French people.
                      He believed that in order to establish a "Republic of Virtue" all civil and foreign threats would first have to be eliminated. Robespierre and the CPS established the Reign of Terror.
                      Anyone suspected of treason, including priests, conter-revolutionaries, girondins, and nobles, was tried and executed. Between 20 and 40 thousand people are believed to have been
                      executed during this period. With the temporary dictatorship mostly successful at eliminating a civil war and conspiracies against the government, the need for the Reign of Terror
                      vanished and took most of Robespierres power with it.</p>
                      <p>On 26 July 1794, Robespierre gave a speech to the National Convention attempting to defend himself and his dignity. His speech seemed to incriminate many convention deputies,
                      and by giving no names Robespierre struck fear into the Convention. They feared that Robespierre was planning another purge, and Robespierre was arrested and guillotined the following day.
                      The execution of Robespierre and the executions of Jacobins known as the "White Terror" marked the end of of the Radical Phase of the French Revolution.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane" id="Reactionary Phase">
                      <p>After Robespierre's execution, the French government passed into the hands of the fourth government in half a decade: the Directory. The Directory came to power through the Constution of YEar 3 (1795).
                      This constitution separated the government into a two body legislature and a five-man executive Directory. The constitution retained some of the freedoms from the 1791 constitution but gave the government
                      the power to remove freedoms during emergencies. It was not a full republic, allowing only property owners to vote, but it was still a massive improvement over the monarchy. The directory however was not
                      very popular and faced corruption and opposition from many Frenchmen. With the Directory being unpopular and France facing war on several fronts, the only credible government instition left was the military.
                      A super popular military general, famous for his skillful use of weaponry and successes against the Austrians and against the British in Egypt, was Napoleon Bonaparte. Regarded as a hero in his homeland,
                      he was asked to step in as a temporary consul after a purge of the directory in June 1799. On 18 November that same year, Napoleon Bonapart and Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès overthrew the Directory and replaced
                      it with a three person consulate. The constitution of Year 7 created a complex government system with a façade of representative government, but power lay in the hands of First Consul Napoleon. He evenrually
                      declared himself emperor in 1804.</p>
                      <p>The overthrow of the directory and the rise of Napoleon to power marked the end of the French Revolution and the beginning of the French Empire.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Article IV – Liberty consists of doing anything which does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the society the fruition of these same rights. These borders can be determined only by the law.
          </p>
          <p>Article V – The law has the right to forbid only actions harmful to society. Anything which is not forbidden by the law cannot be impeded, and no one can be constrained to do what it does not order.

          <p>Article VI – The law is the expression of the general will. All the citizens have the right of contributing personally or through their representatives to its formation. It must be the same for all, either that it protects, or that it punishes. All the citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents.
          </p>
          <p>Article VII – No man can be accused, arrested nor detained but in the cases determined by the law, and according to the forms which it has prescribed. Those who solicit, dispatch, carry out or cause to be carried out arbitrary orders, must be punished; but any citizen called or seized under the terms of the law must obey at once; he renders himself culpable by resistance.
          </p>
          <p>Article VIII – The law should establish only penalties that are strictly and evidently necessary, and no one can be punished but under a law established and promulgated before the offense and legally applied.
          </p>
          <p>Article IX – Any man being presumed innocent until he is declared culpable if it is judged indispensable to arrest him, any rigor which would not be necessary for the securing of his person must be severely reprimanded by the law.
          </p>
          <p>Article X – No one may be disturbed for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by the law.
          </p>
          <p>Article XI – The free communication of thoughts and of opinions is one of the most precious rights of man: any citizen thus may speak, write, print freely, except to respond to the abuse of this liberty, in the cases determined by the law.
          </p>
          <p>Article XII – The guarantee of the rights of man and of the citizen necessitates a public force: this force is thus instituted for the advantage of all and not for the particular utility of those in whom it is trusted.
          </p>
          <p>Article XIII – For the maintenance of the public force and for the expenditures of administration, a common contribution is indispensable; it must be equally distributed to all the citizens, according to their ability to pay.

          <p>Article XIV – Each citizen has the right to ascertain, by himself or through his representatives, the need for a public tax, to consent to it freely, to know the uses to which it is put, and of determining the proportion, basis, collection, and duration.

          <p>Article XV – The society has the right of requesting an account from any public agent of its administration.
          </p>
          <p>Article XVI – Any society in which the guarantee of rights is not assured, nor the separation of powers determined, has no Constitution.
          </p>
          <p>Article XVII – Property being an inviolable and sacred right, no one can be deprived of private usage, if it is not when the public necessity, legally noted, evidently requires it, and under the condition of a just and prior indemnity.
