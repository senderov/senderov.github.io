        <h2 class="title">What and Why?</h2>
        <h5 class="description">After Industrialisation took hold in Europe, two new problems began to arise. Europe no longer had enough raw material or manual labour to grow the industrial economy. The other issue was that markets were becoming so saturated that people no longer had a need to buy things. Europeans became interested in other parts of the world where they could exploit native populations for labour, extract natural resources, and sell goods. Nations also began to realise that colonising other places would increase their political, military, and economic power. This would play a large role in WWI.</h5>
        <h2 class="title">Imperialism in Africa</h2>
        <h5 class="description">Many things made Africa a prime target for colonisation. It was rich in raw materials and fossil fuels that could fuel factories. The African continent contained a massive amount of gold and diamonds, giving individuals massive incentives to launch expeditions. Africa was also full of people, and Europe needed labourers in their colonies to collect resources and work in factories.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">How was Africa Colonised?</h3>
        <h5 class="description">The same things that caused rapid industrialisation and the need for imperialism also allowed imperialism to occur. Steamboats that used the same steam engines that powered factories in Europe were now able to go upriver and reach far into Africa where no European had ever gone. The first fully automated machine gun, the Maxim gun, was invented in 1886. Factories could mass-produce the gun and the necessary ammunition allowing for easy conquests of technologically inferior African people. In addition to improved transportation and weaponry, Europe had developed medications against Malaria that allowed explorers and soldiers to travel and live in Africa without a high risk of dying from disease.</h5>
        <h5 class="description">In addition to its many technological disadvantages, Africa also suffered from its diversity. Africa had thousands of political societies and tribes, separated by large language and ethnic barriers. Colonisers took great advantage of this divide, waiting for groups in Africa to fight each other in a war over land or a resource and then intervening and conquering both weakened sides.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Leopold's Congo</h3>
        <h5 class="description">The most notable and most extreme example of Imperialism was that carried out by King Leopold II of Belgium in the Congo. Leopold didn't feel like a king in Belgium, because the ruling was carried out by parliament. In search of recognition and money, he colonised the Congo, an accessible African region full of people, rubber, and precious metals and minerals.</h5><h5 class="description">Leopold ruled the Congo with an iron fist. Congolese people were forced into harsh manual labour. They were made to mine ore, collect rubber, and serve Belgian military needs. Women and girls were frequently raped by European men. Congolese workers were given barely enough food to survive and were only provided with one or two sets of clothing a year, and were rarely given a second pair of shoes in their lives. Every worker in the Congo operated under an almost unattainable collection quota, and anyone caught resisting, stealing, or slacking around would be subject to the removal of their hands.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Berlin Conference</h3>
        <h5 class="description">The Berlin conference of 1884-85 was organised by German chancellor Otto von Bismarck. The single purpose of the conference was to regulate European imperialism in Africa and prevent the outbreak of war. It set up a method for partitioning Africa: any nation could lay claim to any region of Africa, and they could keep that region as long as they were able to maintain control over it. The Berlin Conference essentially formalised the European Scramble for Africa and gave King Leopold II permission to claim and rule the Congo territory without repercussion.</h5>
        <h2 class="title">Imperialism in India</h2>
        <h5 class="description">On the Indian subcontinent, it was the British responsible for imperialism. Before the British began colonising India, it was responsible for over a quarter of the world economy. India had many sought-after spices and lots of cotton to make clothes. The Brits saw India as a perfect opportunity: not only could it be the main supply of their raw materials, it would also be the largest consumer of British goods. The British East India company was the private trade entity responsible for colonising much of India. It conquered the weak and failing Mughal empire and the rest of the Indian subcontinent using the classic divide and conquer strategy. They took advantage of the disagreements between Hindus and Muslims and set them against each other.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Effects on India</h3>
        <h5 class="description">The British ruled India primarily for profit. The main source of this profit was the textile industry. India was the largest producer of textiles, but they were handmade and expensive. The British East India company saw this as an opportunity to make money. The British built extensive railroad systems to extract raw materials from India. The most significant product taken from India was cotton. The EIC would use Indian cotton to mass produce clothing in British factories and then sell it back to India. By making the purchase of non-British goods in India illegal, this allowed them to make a profit off of the very country they were stealing from.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Indian National Congress</h3>
        <h5 class="description">The creation of the Indian National Congress, which first convened in 1885, was one of the most significant milestones in Indian opposition to British imperialism. It was made up of the middle class and the indigenous elite. They had gone through the British education system but felt rejected and excluded from Imperial authority. They were afraid that the British would never see them as equals. After WWII and the success of India's independence movement, the INC would become the first Indian Government.</h5>
        <h4 class="title">Strategy Against Britain</h4>
        <h5 class="description">The INC was divided into groups based on their strategy against the British. The first group, spearheaded by Mahatma Gandhi, believed in nonviolent resistance. They advocated for public confrontation, peaceful protest, and nonviolent noncooperation. They would refuse purchase of British textiles, not resist arrest, and never act in a single act of violence against Britain, who would not be able to blame them for any acts of violence. The other group was known as the militant wing. They were very agitated that India was still under British rule and did not believe that nonviolence would ever be able to win. Gandhi's ideas came out on top.</h5>
