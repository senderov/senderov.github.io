        <h2 class="title">Congress of Vienna</h2>
        <h5 class="description">The Congress of Vienna was a series of meetings between delegates from the five major European powers, Russia, Prussia, Britain, Austria, and France. It was led by Austrian chancellor Klemens von Metternich and was established to solve one major problem: they needed to "fix" Europe and create a better balance of power after Napoleon's large-scale conquest.
        </h5><h5 class="description">The main solution of the Congress was to redistribute conquered territory and create stronger border territories around France to keep it from gaining too much power. They established the kingdom of the Netherlands and gave the Rhine to Prussia, as well as several other territorial redistributions. The Congress did not care about creating a unified Germany, something that would eventually happen anyway, and left it divided into states and kingdoms as it had been during Napoleon's time. France's boundaries were left alone and they stayed the same as they had been before and throughout the revolution.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Hundred Days</h3>
        <h5 class="description">The Hundred Days were a brief period during the Congress of Vienna after Napoleon returned from his exile on Elba in March of 1815. He campaigned around France where he still had significant support and within only 2 months he had raised an army of over 200 thousand. The nations from the Congress of Vienna had signed a treaty pledging 150 thousand men each to defend Europe against Napoleon and they planned an invasion of France for the beginning of July. Napoleon was not interested in repeating the events that led to his defeat previously and decided to attack in June. After seeing some initial successes against the not fully assembled coalition army. Despite this, his army was defeated only 3 days later at the Battle of Waterloo after Prussia joined the British army against Napoleon. The British and the Prussian armies pushed the French all the way to Paris and on 22 June Napoleon once again abdicated the throne. After stopping any leftover pro-Napoleonic movements in France, Louis XVIII was restored to the throne and Napoleon officially surrendered a week later. He was exiled to Saint Helena never to be seen in Europe again.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Concert of Europe</h3>
        <h5 class="description">The Congress of Vienna established the concert of Europe as an extension of itself. It was a loose union of the major powers delegates from which met every annum to ensure stability in Europe. It contained the principle of intervention the goal of which was to prevent further revolutions and formed an agreement between the major powers allowing any empire facing a rebellion to call upon the help of the others if necessary. The Concert of Europe restored the leadership systems of Europe before the revolution via the principle of legitimacy where the right to power was determined by hereditary status and the needs of the Church. Monarchs, nobles, and clergy all returned to power. The Concert successfully stopped several uprisings, but ultimately failed after only 8 years when Britain decided it no longer wanted to get involved in continental conflicts.</h5>
