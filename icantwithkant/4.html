        <h2 class="title">Congress of Vienna</h2>
        <h5 class="description">The Congress of Vienna was a series of meetings between delegates from the five major European powers, Russia, Prussia, Britain, Austria, and France. It was led by Austrian chancellor Klemens von Metternich and was established to solve one major problem: they needed to "fix" Europe and create a better balance of power after Napoleon's large-scale conquest.
        </h5><h5 class="description">The main solution of the Congress was to redistribute conquered territory and create stronger border territories around France to keep it from gaining too much power. They established the kingdom of the Netherlands and gave the Rhine to Prussia, as well as several other territorial redistributions. The Congress did not care about creating a unified Germany, something that would eventually happen anyway, and left it divided into states and kingdoms as it had been during Napoleon's time. France's boundaries were left alone and they stayed the same as they had been before and throughout the revolution.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Hundred Days</h3>
        <h5 class="description">The Hundred Days were a brief period during the Congress of Vienna after Napoleon returned from his exile on Elba in March of 1815. He campaigned around France where he still had significant support and within only 2 months he had raised an army of over 200 thousand. The nations from the Congress of Vienna had signed a treaty pledging 150 thousand men each to defend Europe against Napoleon and they planned an invasion of France for the beginning of July. Napoleon was not interested in repeating the events that led to his defeat previously and decided to attack in June. After seeing some initial successes against the not fully assembled coalition army. Despite this, his army was defeated only 3 days later at the Battle of Waterloo after Prussia joined the British army against Napoleon. The British and the Prussian armies pushed the French all the way to Paris and on 22 June Napoleon once again abdicated the throne. After stopping any leftover pro-Napoleonic movements in France, Louis XVIII was restored to the throne and Napoleon officially surrendered a week later. He was exiled to Saint Helena never to be seen in Europe again.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Concert of Europe</h3>
        <h5 class="description">The Congress of Vienna established the concert of Europe as an extension of itself. It was a loose union of the major powers delegates from which met every annum to ensure stability in Europe. It contained the principle of intervention the goal of which was to prevent further revolutions and formed an agreement between the major powers allowing any empire facing a rebellion to call upon the help of the others if necessary. The Concert of Europe restored the leadership systems of Europe before the revolution via the principle of legitimacy where the right to power was determined by hereditary status and the needs of the Church. Monarchs, nobles, and clergy all returned to power. The Concert successfully stopped several uprisings, but ultimately failed after only 8 years when Britain decided it no longer wanted to get involved in continental conflicts.</h5>

              <h3 class="card-title text-center">Nationalism</h3>
              <div class="card-body">
                <p>In laymen's terms, Nationalism is a patriotic feeling among a group of people. A nation-state is the government of a nation. The nation-state represents the nation to the rest of the world and embodies the ideals and the people of said nation. There are many descriptions of what makes up or defines a nation. Three different but very common ideas are those of Ernest Renan, Giuseppe Mazzini, and Heinrich von Treitschke.</p>
                <h4 class="title text-center">Renan</h4>
                <p>Renan was a French philosopher, historian, and writer. He wrote, “What is a nation?” In it, he described what made a nationality what it is. According to Renan, there is no pure race and the noblest countries are those with mixed blood. He believed there are far more important things contributing to nationality. On the topics of religion and language he argued that although they do invite people to create a common language, they can neither force people to unite nor give them a substantial base upon which to do so. To Renan, a nation is a soul, a spiritual principle, a possession of a rich common history. To him, a nation cannot exist without a desire for unity among people and a will to make sacrifices for the nation as a whole.</p>
                <h4 class="title text-center">Mazzini</h4>
                <p>Mazzini was an Italian politician. He had opinions on both what made a nation and how one should be run. His ideas were similar to those of Renan and those of classical liberals. To Mazzini, a nation was a group of people connected by many factors like language and religion who shared a love for their country. These people united to work toward the same goal and improve all of their lives. Mazzini believed that class hierarchies were detrimental to society and that the best way to govern a nation was through the will of the people and popular sovereignty. He also believed that citizens of a nation are humans first and citizens second and that they must aid and love all humanity regardless of differences.</p>
                <h4 class="title text-center">Treitschke</h4>
                <p>Treitschke was a German historian and political writer. His views about the nation were very polar and very different from those of Mazzini and Renan. He believed that only the will of a monarch can govern a nation and that all people of that nation should be loyal and subservient to the state. A nation was to be a moral community that must constantly strive to increase its power. He had very many controversial opinions on what made a true German, and was openly racist and praised the eradication of other races. He hated Poles, socialists, Catholics, and was very openly antisemitic. He declared that "The Jews are our misfortune!", and claimed that while the Jews were necessary to German history due to their financial abilities, they were no longer of use to the world as the Aryan race had acquired all of the necessary skills. Treitschke also believed that perpetual peace was a hoax and that war was always guaranteed to eventually occur.</p>

              <h3 class="card-title text-center">Classical Liberalism</h3>
              <div class="card-body">
                <p>Liberalism started in the early nineteenth century and built on some of the ideas of the enlightenment and the French Revolution. Liberalism came about as a response to the lack of political changes during urbanisation and the industrial revolution. These periods marked massive changes in the economic and social structures of Europe but had little political changes from earlier times resulting in mismanagement of people and companies. Much of the Liberal ideology was built on the beliefs of John Locke.</p>
                <h4 class="title text-center">Liberal Beliefs</h4>
                <p>Liberal beliefs on the role and type of government were heavily influenced by John Locke. Liberals believed that the government can only be formed with the consent of the governed. The best form of government to them was to have a parliamentary body of elected representatives. They believed in a constitutional government with broad political participation but did not support direct democracy. Liberal governments had freedom of press and religion and protected the natural rights and liberties of citizens. Economically, Liberals believed in little economic regulation from the government, allowing anybody to use any of their skills to provide products or services to others instead of predetermined hereditary roles. Most liberals were commercial or professional bourgeoisie.</p>

              <h3 class="card-title text-center">Conservatism</h3>
              <div class="card-body">
                <p>Conservatism as a properly separate political ideology began among the supporters of the Bourbon monarchy after it was restored in place of Napoleon. Conservatism in the 19th century was built around preserving top0he old and more established system. Conservatives preferred to keep the system that had developed over several centuries and through hundreds of generations over any kind of change. They claimed that the government should serve the existing order instead of controlling it like the Liberals wanted to do.</p>
                <h4 class="title text-center">Conservative Beliefs</h4>
                <p>Conservatives believed that the best forms of government were monarchies and landed aristocracies(rule by wealthy landowners). The goals of said government were to protect the money and property of old nobles and to keep the existing power structure in place. Conservatives believed in divine right and were strongly against constitutions and representative government. Religion was a major pillar of conservatism and was considered a necessity for a functioning government. From an economic standpoint, they advocated for a controlled military economy, with strong military funding and heavy trade regulations. Most conservatives were of current or former royal lineage, members of the high nobility, or clergy.</p>

              <div class="card-body">
                <p>Radicalism, like conservatism and liberalism, began in the late 18th century but started actually growing popular in the early 19th. The term radical was often used to describe champions of French Revolutionary beliefs. Most radicals were members of the proletariat (the working class), or members of the middle-class bourgeoisie. They were not fond of monarchies and believed them to be oppressive and limiting natural rights. Radicals wanted voting rights, freedom of the press, and economic equality for all (no tax exemptions). Radicals also advocated for the complete separation of church and state, arguing that religious institutions should have no say in whether or not a person can serve in the government. They wanted to be governed by a constitutional republic run by the will of voters. These radicals were often called republicans due to little difference between the two ideologies after the end of the French Revolution.</p>

        <h2 class="title">German Unification</h2>
        <h5 class="description">After Napoleon's defeat, the Congress of Vienna reinstated the Germanic states into the German Confederation and put them under Austrian control. The Austrian empire was oppressive to Germans not allowing them to unite. The German's were not happy with this and most states of the Confederation joined a non-political economic union with Prussia. Eventually, the German Confederation forced Prussia to give them a constitution.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Frankfurt Parliament</h3>
        <h5 class="description">The Frankfurt parliament was created to plan for a united Germany in 1948 after Prussia gave them a constitution. The majority of parliament was made up of moderate liberals. The Parliament proposed its own constitution to both Austria and Prussia. Prussia, being a conservative state, declined the constitution outright. Austria offered its own constitution to the Parliament saying that Austria would support a unified Germany if all of Austria was allowed to be part of it. The parliament declined the Austrian constitution because they only wanted the German provinces and then fell apart due to lack of support.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Bismarck</h3>
        <h5 class="description">Otto von Bismarck was appointed by King Wilhelm I as chancellor and foreign minister of Prussia. In 1862 Bismarck gave his "Blood and Iron" speech detailing how Germany should be unified. In it, he said that "the great independence of the individual makes it difficult in Prussia to govern with the constitution." Bismarck believed that Germans had much more individual independence and individual thought that the French and that unlike the latter, it would be impossible to govern a unified Germany with such a transparent government. Bismarck said that Germany did not want Prussia's liberalism, but their power. He decided to leave the mostly pro-French provinces of Wurttemberg, Bavaria, and Baden out of a unified Germany. The unification would occur not through speeches and votes, but "by blood and iron."</h5>
        <h5 class="description">Bismarck was a big fan of the Realpolitik political philosophy. He used Prussia's military power and many immoral strategies to gain political strength. Bismarck frequently antagonised other nations and caused wars to weaken his enemies. Bismarck started a war with Austria against Denmark after Denmark annexed a German territory into its empire. The territory was split in half between Austria and Prussia. Bismarck didn't like this arrangement so he accused Austria of causing trouble in the Prussian part before conquering Schleswig entirely. Austria declared war on Prussia and lost, after which Bismarck created the North German Confederacy with all of the German states except the three pro-French ones. Napoleon III was not happy and demanded formerly French territories on the Rhine to return to him, but Bismarck refused. France lost the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia and Bismarck won the three German territories away from France. Wilhelm, I became the first Kaiser(Emperor) of the newly formed united German Reich.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Consequences of German Unification</h3>
        <h5 class="description">After Germany unified, the power balance in Europe was significantly disrupted. All of a sudden, there was a massive military powerhouse that had not been there months before in the middle of the continent. The German Reich also had a lot of money and a lot of resources. The resources gave Germany a strong advantage in Europe when the industrial revolution occurred. Britain was not very fond of Germany. Not only was Germany an industrial powerhouse, but it was also the largest consumer of British goods. At the time, a war with Germany would be devastating for Britain. The Reich was also a conservative superpower. Bismarck suppressed liberals and found ways to set them against each other. Germany influenced the politics of a large part of Europe increasing popularity of conservative beliefs. The last major effect was Germany's poor relationship with France. When Germany formed it annexed the territory of Alsace-Lorraine from France as it had a large amount of Germans. But there were also many French people there, and this act heavily increased tensions with France for decades</h5>
