        <h5 class="description">The industrial revolution occured in the Late 18th and early 19th century at the same time as the French
        Revolution and the Napoleonic Era. It was a mass adoption of new manufacturing techniques, made possible by the invention of a
        continuous rotary steam engine by James Watt in 1871. It was caused by the need for more products and by Capitalism, which was
        an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and their use to turn a profit. The Industrial Revolution
        changed the face of the economy, and of warfare across the entire world.</h5>
        <h2 class="title">Agricultural Revolution</h2>
        <h5 class="description">For the roughly one hundred years before the industrial revolution, Britain went through the agricultural
        revolution. The main development allowing the agricultural revolution to happen was the four field crop rotation system. Under that
        system three fields were rotated with the different crops, and the fourth field was planted with legumes such as peas. The legumes,
        which contain bacteria cabale of fixing nitrogen help fertilise the land of the fourth field allowing more crop to grow the following years
        and almost eliminated fallow land with the whole entire field being used to grow crops.</h5>
        <h5 class="description">The other major development contributing to the efficiency of agriculture were the Enclosure Acts. These were passed by
        the British govenrment and privatised common land and establishing property lines and borders. The individual farmers who used smaller plots of
        land for substinence farming were bought out by rich commercially-minded landowners. These landowners were able to much more effectively implement
        crop rotation systems and invested heavily into new equipment. They offered all of the small farmers they bought out jobs on the farm in exchange
        for a wage and enough food to survive, and the rest of the crop was sold on the market, mostly in cities. These wealthy landlords were the early
        examples of capitalists. This system of large-scale farming allowed for significantly fewer people to produce a greater amount of food and allowed
        many substinence farmers to pursue other jobs, something that would be necessary for the upcoming Industrial Revolution.</h5>
        <h2 class="title">The Cottage System</h2>
        <h5 class="description">The Cottage System was a perfect example of pre-industrial capitalism, known as merchant capitalism or the "middle-man system". It was a simple system
        based in the transfer of goods in domestic manufacturing, when the means of production were owned by individuals. A good example of this system was the
        textile industry. Merchants would buy cotton from plantations and sell it to spinners at a small profit. The spinners used a spinning machine in their
        homes to turn the cotton fibre into threads, which were sold back to the merchants at a profit for the spinners. The merchants sold those threads to weavers,
        once again at a small profit, and the weavers turned the thread into cloth and sold it back to the merchants. The merchants would take that cloth and sell it to dyers that
        dyed the cloth different colours and sold the dyed cloth back to merhcants. Finally, the merchants sold the dyed cloth on village markets for people to purchase and use to make
        clothing for themselves. In this system, everyone involved was able to make a profitable business, but the merchants profited significantly more than the individual producers
        and made significantly more money to reinvest into upscaling their business. These merchants were the rich people who became the first factory owners of the industrial revolution.</h5>
        <h2 class="title">The Revolution</h2>
        <h5 class="description">Industrialisation is the spread of industry on a wide scale. After the invention of the steam engine in 1871, three things were necessary for industiralisation
        to happen. The first necessity was land. For factories to be able to exist, it was needed to have accessible natural resources, mainly coal for burning, iron for construction, and water to
        be used as steam. Fertile farmland was also needed to feed workers and free up labour, and this was accomplished by the privatisation of agriculture and the four field system. The second
        necessity was labour. Factories needed many workers to operate, and those workers were frequently former farmers who had been bought out by wealthy landowners. The third necessity was capital.
        Factories, although incredibly profitable, required large amounts of money for their construction and operation. There were few people with enough money to build a factory, and those who did
        were possed either a large amount of inherited wealth, or were the merchant capitalists in the cottage system looking to increase their fortune even further.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Capitalism</h3>
        <h5 class="description">It is not necessary to describe in detail how the industrial revolution progressed: wealthy individuals built factories, got richer, then built more factories and gained
        even more wealth. What is important, however, is the Capitalist ideology that caused people to pursue industrialisation, and the reason that it worked. Capitalism was an economic and somewhat
        political system where the trade and industry is privately owned and driven by profit. Capitalism had four basic principles: privatisation, competition, free market, and division of labour.
        Private ownership of the means of production and the distribution of goods allowed not only greater efficiency in mass-production, but it also cut out the middle-man and removed the incremental
        price hikes. This allowed a factory owner to buy a raw good and completely produce the finished good before selling it at a market, resulting in much lower prices overall. </h5><h5 class="description">Competition was also necessary
        because it caused factory owners to strive to decrease production and market costs while increasing quality. When multiple corporations are battling for a market, the one with the greater value product always
        wins. A market free of government regulation and the supply and demand system were also important to the sucess of capitalism. When demand for a product increased, factory owners could increase costs
        while still ensuring sales and raising the profits. When demand dwindled, the price of a market good could be lowered to increase the amount of people who could afford to buy the product. Lastly, factories
        operated on the division of labour. Each worker spent their entire employment doing exactly one action, like screwing a pair of steel plates together. This allowed workers to develop highly specialised skills
        necessary to their job and significantly increased the output of a factory and decreased the amount of training needed to hire workers. These factories provided more affordable goods to a larger market and
        put the cottage system and many individual artisans out of business.</h5>
        <h3 class="title">Socialism</h3>
        <h5 class="description">Socialism developed in Europe as a response to the rising inequality during industrialisation. It increased government regulation in the economy.  A socialist system provided a socio-economic
          “safety net” for people; the government can manufacture goods and provide for basic necessities without needing to turn a profit for itself.</h5>
